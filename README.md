# Interactive-note-taking-script
This is a simple example of if else statements for bash. Prompts user with different tasks they can do within a terminal. Menu list offers read (with cat command),
write (with nano editor), search (with grep), math (opens python ide), and an exit option. The math option includes a basic tutorial of how simple math works in
python using the P.E.M.D.A.S system.
This script is primarily targeted at new linux users. I hope you like it.
